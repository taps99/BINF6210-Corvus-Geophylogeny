# Geography and Evolutionary Diversification of the Corvus genus

### Introduction
The members of the Corvus genus are one of the most interesting creatures in the world. Their remarkable intelligence sets them apart from other bird groups. With over 46 known extant species, it is no surprise that members of this genus are found all around the world (Garcia-Porta et al., 2022). Different species of Corvus have adapted to various geographical climates as well, which makes them all the more remarkable. There are many ecological factors to consider in the context of diversification. It is also important to realize the impact that these factors can potentially have on allopatric speciation within a genus. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to explore this topic with a diverse genus such as Corvus. In this project, the objective is to analyze sequence and geographical data for the Corvus genus in order to investigate the relationship between geography and the diversification of this genus. Do the species within the Corvus genus love within the same geographic region, or is there clear evidence of allopatric divergence?

### Methods
The purpose of this project was to use publicly available sequence data combined with occurrence data to generate a geophylogeny for the Corvus genus. 
First, the acquisition of sequence data from NCBI using the Rentrez package, followed by quality control and filtering. Then, occurrence data was acquired from GBIF, and also underwent quality control and filtering steps.
Then, a MUSCLE sequence alignment was done, ensuring that sequences with large amounts of gaps will be penalized. The results of the alignment were then converted to a distance matrix, which was then used to generate the geophylogeny alongside the GBIF occurrence data.

### Discussion

As mentioned in the introduction, there are at least 46 extant members of the Corvus genus. This genus also exhibits a widespread distribution across the world. As a result, I wanted to investigate the link between geography and diversification for this genus. For this analysis, I chose cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) as the marker of choice for analyzing sequence data for the Corvus genus. This mitochondrial gene is commonly used in phylogenetic analyses, and has also been used in the study of phylogenetic relationships for members of this genus (Mansha et al., 2021). During my analysis, I was only able to acquire COI sequence data for only 15 of the 46 known species of this genus from NCBI. Therefore, the results of this analysis do not encompass the entirety of the Corvus genus. However, I was still able to achieve promising results by the end of my analysis. I used the Nucleotide database from NCBI to get the COI sequence data for this genus. During my search, I chose to filter the sequence length parameter so that it would only return sequences of 400 to 700 base pairs. COI is usually near 650 base pairs in length, so I thought that filtering for sequence length will  give me more accurate hits. After filtering the sequence data, I generated a histogram to showcase the distribution of COI sequence lengths for this genus (Figure 1). After this, I was able to successfuly align the sequences, and then use the results of my alignment to generate clusters for the members of this genus. Different models were tested during the generation of these clusters, and I found that they all gave similar results. 

The other half of my analysis consisted of gathering occurrence data for the Corvus genus from GBIF. I was able to successfully gather this geographical data for all of the species in my sequence dataset. For this analysis, I wanted to make sure that I had an equal amount of geographical data for each species. I chose to use 10 data points for each species. At first I tried using more data points, but the results were unclear. With this data, I was able to generate a geophylogeny for the Corvus genus (Figure 2). This geophylogeny allowed me to visualize the widespread distribution and diversity of this genus. Just by looking at the geophylogeny, it is clear that there are distinct clusters that exist for certain species of this genus. For instance, Corvus albicollis is clearly clustered within the region of South Africa. However, the distribution of some other species seems to be more dispersed. This is the case for Corvus dauuricus, where its geographical distribution seems to range from India all the way to Russia and even Japan! I also noticed that there are no data points within South America. I thought that it was very interesting to see how species within similar clusters are so geographically dispersed from each other. Garcia-Porta et al. (2022) studied the different factors that lead to the global radiation of crows and ravens, and found that numerous ecological factors need to be taken into account when analyzing the divergence of this genus. For instance, the divergence of this genus could have been a result of their ability to survive new environments, even if the conditions are sub-optimal for their survival. In the context of my analysis, I would agree that there is evidence of allopatric divergence for this genus. Of course, one of the limitations of my analysis was the inability to acquire data for every species of the genus, which would have given me the opportunity to accurately analyze the genus in its entirety. If I were to research this topic in the future, I would make sure to have data for all species of the genus. I would also dive deeper to research the link between ecological factors and the divergence of this genus.
